# DevNet Back End

# Description
This is the back end repo for the collaborative GA group project number 3.
DevNet provides a space for current students, alumni, and new developers to post interview questions they've encountered during their job search.
The purpose of this is to provide insight for those yet to start their job search, and provide live data for those already searching.
The goal is to build community, offer support and solutions that may not have been previously considered.

# Brief Example
When the backend server is running successfully at http://localhost:9000/devnet you will see the post data parsed as a json object
